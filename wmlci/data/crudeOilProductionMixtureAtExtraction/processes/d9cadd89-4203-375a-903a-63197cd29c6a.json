Mixed alcohols are a co-product in the thermochemical process, and its impact is accounted for by means of an energy allocation between ethanol and mixed alcohols based on their LHV. (Hsu, et al., 2010) The term “mixed alcohols” refers to a mixture of C1 – C8 alcohols, with preference towards the higher alcohols (C2-C6).  Mixed alcohols catalysts are typically categorized into several groups based on their composition and/or derivation. (NREL, 2007) Allocation was performed assuming the LHV of ethanol \u003d 29.7 MJ/kg and the LHV of mixed alcohols \u003d 34.4 MJ/kg (using butanol as a proxy for mixed alcohols).","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"00.00.018","lastChange":"2025-03-31T01:52:38.619Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"CAUSAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-12-31","validUntil":"2009-12-30","timeDescription":"2005-2009","geographyDescription":"North America","technologyDescription":"modern","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"5e8e63da-4488-3b1d-98fb-446078a7cfac","name":"Hess, J.
