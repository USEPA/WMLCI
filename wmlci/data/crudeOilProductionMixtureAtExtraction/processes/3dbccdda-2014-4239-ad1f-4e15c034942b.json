Two main processes are used to polymerize VCM and produce PVC: suspension and dispersion. Most PVC produced in North America is through suspension polymerization, and so it is the polymerization method considered within the scope of this study. Processing for dispersion grade resin is not considered. In the suspension process, the VCM is fed into a reactor with water and suspension agents to suspend droplets of VCM. An initiator is then fed into the reactor to facilitate the polymerization of VCM to PVC. The PVC, which is formed suspended in water, then undergoes a drying process in order to obtain the S-PVC resin.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional","modelingConstantsDescription":"Data was collected from four manufacturers which represent 100% of the S-PVC resin produced in the US in 2022. A total of ten facilities provided their data for 2022 and the LCI was developed using mass allocation. Data was reviewed and verified by each of the four companies. When a material is not obtainable in the available LCI databases, another chemical which has similar manufacturing and environmental impacts may be used as a proxy to represent the actual chemical. The Proxy Chemical List used in this analysis is provided in the Data Quality tables in Appendix B. The cogeneration process is similar across the S-PVC plants to produce S-PVC resin. The cogeneration process produces 50% electricity and 50% steam. Emissions to water and air were considered within the scope of this study and were accounted for based off of quantities in annual emissions reporting from each company. Data validation was performed through mass balances.","completenessDescription":"The following cut-off criteria was used throughout the study. Processes whose total contribution to the final result, with respect to their mass and in relation to all considered impact categories, is less than 1% can be neglected. The sum of the neglected processes may not exceed 5% by mass and by 5% of the considered impact categories. Construction of capital equipment, maintenance of operation and support equipment, and human labor and employee commute are all excluded from this life cycle assessment. This assessment is cradle-to-gate and excludes any processes downstream of the manufacturer.\r\nNo other known processes within the system boundary were excluded. All data was provided by the manufacturers and reviewed by the manufacturers again after the results had been calculated to ensure completeness. The mass balance for this process was calculated.","dataSelectionDescription":"Data was collected from four manufacturers which represent 100% of the S-PVC resin produced in the US in 2022. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"A weighted average was calculated from the primary data collected from the four manufacturers (ten facilities) of S-PVC in the US.","samplingDescription":"The system boundary is cradle-to-gate and includes the use of raw materials entering the facilities, the transportation to get raw and supporting materials to the manufacturing facilities, and the processing inputs and outputs to produce PVC resin.
