Impacts associated with effluent release and sludge disposal in a landfill are modeled in separate (linked) processes.

Level one refers to the lowest nutrient standard. Level five produces the cleanest effluent. If possible, select the level of wastewater treatment based on permit standards for the target wastewater treatment plant and the type of biological process used. \r\n\r\nIf comparing LCIA results against source: The linked background electricity dataset has significantly lower impacts than the grid in the original source. Additionally, significant changes in characterization factors occurred between USETox versions 1 and 2, which strongly influences toxicity results for this process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"bc1c901c-10a8-4187-9d13-70f2bf0815a8","name":"CAPDETWorks Wastewater Model Version 3.
