Emissions and fuel consumption data are calculated using EPA\u0027s Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), the regulatory model to determine emission inventories for highway vehicles, including cars, trucks, and buses. The reference flow is the movement of 1 metric ton of goods for a distance of 1 km.\n","category":"48-49: Transportation and Warehousing/4841: General Freight Trucking","version":"01.00.000","lastChange":"2025-03-27T03:04:33.223Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2024-01-01","validUntil":"2024-12-31","timeDescription":"This process reflects the vehicle fleet as estimated in 2024. MOVES calculates an age distribution by vehicle type, where age is defined as the difference between a vehicle\u0027s model year and the year of analysis. MOVES employs a number of different age dependent factors, including deterioration of engine and emission after-treatment technology due to tampering and mal-maintenance, vehicle scrappage and fleet turnover and mileage accumulation over the lifetime of the vehicle.\n","geographyDescription":"This process represents emissions from vehicles operating in all U.S. states.\n","technologyDescription":"FHWA\u0027s vehicle classification specifies that single unit trucks are singleframe trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of greater than 10,000 pounds or with two axles and at least six tiresâ€”colloquially known as \"dualies\". The single unit truck vehicle category is quite diverse, including (but not limited to) delivery, box, flatbed, cement mixers, and tow trucks, among other body styles and vocations. This source type includes all single unit trucks that are not refuse trucks or motor homes, which travel less than or equal to 200 miles a day.\n\n","inventoryMethodDescription":"Not applicable.\n","modelingConstantsDescription":"Not applicable.\n","completenessDescription":"Included in the inventory are emissions from operations (i.e., tailpipe exhaust) as well as idling and truck hotelling (both extended engine idling and auxiliary power unit use). Particulate matter from brake and tire wear is also included. Evaporative emissions while the vehicle is soaking (engine off) are not included. Manufacturing of vehicles, roads, and other infrastructure are not included in this dataset.\n","dataSelectionDescription":"MOVES runs were performed at the default settings at the state level.\n","dataTreatmentDescription":"MOVES combines in-use emission rates and detailed fleet populations and activity, frequently in the form of vehicle miles or kilometers traveled, to calculate inventories.\nAverage payload estimates are required to calculate LCI data per unit of good transported. The average payloads by MOVES source type were estimated from the 2002 Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau and 2012 and 2017 Freight Analysis Framework (FAF) statistics collected by the Federal Highway Administration.\nThe mean of the average reported payloads across 2002, 2012, and 2017 are used.  The distance-weighted payload in US short tons as applied for single unit trucks is 6.94 tons.\n","samplingDescription":"Emissions and activity data for each state are combined to generate an activity-weighted average for each region. No uncertainty was assessed.\n","dataCollectionDescription":"MOVES runs were performed using MOVES4.0.1 in 2024.\n","useAdvice":"This process is intended to connect to fuel supply processes in the USLCI or electricity from the U.S. Electricity Baseline.\n","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"3d067546-a4b5-3b06-aafc-7334fdf3117b","name":"USEPA (2024) MOVES4"},{"@type":"Source","@id":"e5de2b03-c042-3090-94d9-29d20f94d81a","name":"FHWA (2020) Freight Analysis Framework"}],"reviews":[{"reviewType":"Independent external review","scopes":[],"details":"Review provided by NREL third-party; documentation and response documented in attached source.\n","report":{"@type":"Source","@id":"6ead8c12-dfd7-317a-b3a8-b8dabd81e973","name":"ERG (2025) MOVES onroad v1.0"},"assessment":[]}],"projectDescription":"This dataset was developed by the Federal LCA Commons Data Curator Eastern Research Group, Inc.
