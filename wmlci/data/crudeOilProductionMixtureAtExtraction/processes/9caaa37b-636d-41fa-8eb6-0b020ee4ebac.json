That model is based on the 2007 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), which captures data on shipments originating from certain business establishments located in the 50 states and DC. The CFS definition of a shipment is \"a single movement of goods, commodities, or products from an establishment owned or operated by the same company as the originating establishment.\" Shipments that originate and terminate in a foregin location but pass through the US are not included. Imported products are accounted for at the point that they leave the importer\u0027s initial domestic location for shipment to another location. Shipments that pass through foreign countries are included as long as the shipment originates and terminates in the US. Mileage calculated for these shipments exclude the international segment. \r\n\r\nShipment data was collected through a mailout/mailback questionnaire where establishments were asked to provide shipment information about a sample of individual outbound shipments during a specified week in each calendar quarter. The distance traveled by each freight shipment sampled for the 2007 CFS was estimated using routing algorithms and an integrated, intermodal transportation network created specifically for this purpose.","dataCollectionDescription":"Data collected for the year 2011","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"5c167982-0d33-4f9f-ada7-839ef334b5c0","name":"Argonne National Laboratory (2013) Update to Transportation Parameters"}],"intendedApplication":"This process is applicable for modelling the fuel input into mobile equipment.","projectDescription":"This process has been updated by the FLCAC Data Curator.","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"38e67478-a915-43d9-ad67-e25db79a4acc","name":"Franklin Associates, A Division of ERG","category":"Organisations"},"creationDate":"2019-05-13T18:14:24.268Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"610557c9-82dd-49fa-845a-cbdce738cd44","name":"Argonne National Laboratory (2024) R\u0026D GREET"},"isCopyrightProtected":false,"restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.
