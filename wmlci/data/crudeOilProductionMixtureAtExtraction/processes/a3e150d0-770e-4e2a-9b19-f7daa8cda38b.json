This dataset was developed for chlorine use in PVC manufacturing. This process represents all chlorine produced by the suspension grade PVC resin manufacturers in the United States. Both membrane and diaphragm cell technologies are used, with membrane cells being the more common technology. The studied system includes all processes involved in the chloralkali electrolysis production process, including incoming transport. Mass allocation is used to allocated inputs and outputs among the three products: chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"00.01.015","lastChange":"2025-03-31T14:38:16.673Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2022-01-01","validUntil":"2022-12-31","timeDescription":"This data represents operations for the 2022 calendar year.","geographyDescription":"This data represents six manufacturing sites located in Texas and Louisiana.","technologyDescription":"This process represents the chloralkali process used to produce chlorine for the use in suspension grade PVC resin. Both membrane and diaphragm cell technologies are used, with membrane cells being the more common technology. Co-products include hydrogen and sodium hydroxide. Mass allocation was used to determine the impacts of each co-product.\r\n\r\nIn the chlor-alkali process, a brine solution (aqueous sodium chloride) undergoes electrolysis to produce chlorine gas, hydrogen gas, and sodium hydroxide. Commercially, two main types of electrolytic cells are used for the chlor-alkali process: diaphragm cells and membrane cells. Membrane cells were developed more recently and are the most commonly used process today. While the treatment of the chlorine and hydrogen gases from processes using both cells are similar, with membrane cells, the sodium hydroxide can be more easily concentrated with less energy.\r\n\r\nSeveral chlor-alkali facilities utilize cogeneration as a method of producing steam and electricity. Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and steam. Within the chlor-alkali plants, electricity, natural gas, hydrogen, water, and sulfuric acid are inputs for the cogeneration process. Based on plant data collected on the cogeneration process at two chlor-alkali plants, the output energy is 49% steam and 51% electricity. This process was assumed to be the same across chlor-alkali plants.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional","modelingConstantsDescription":"Data was collected from four manufacturers which represent 100% of the S-PVC resin produced in the US in 2022. A total of six facilities provided their data for 2022 and the LCI was developed using mass allocation. Data was reviewed and verified by each of the four companies. Mass allocation is used to allocate inputs and outputs to the coproducts produced within the chlor-alkali process. The hydrogen produced as a coproduct is used as an onsite fuel or as a fuel within a downstream process to produce the S-PVC resin. The cogeneration process of electricity and steam is similar across the chlor-alkali plants to produce S-PVC resin. The cogeneration process was analyzed based off of inputs and outputs provided by two sites and assumed to be consistent across all sites and companies. The cogeneration process produces 51% electricity and 49% steam. Emissions to water and air were considered within the scope of this study and were accounted for based off of quantities in annual emissions reporting from each company. Data validation was performed through mass balances.","completenessDescription":"The following cut-off criteria was used throughout the study. Processes whose total contribution to the final result, with respect to their mass and in relation to all considered impact categories, is less than 1% can be neglected. The sum of the neglected processes may not exceed 5% by mass and by 5% of the considered impact categories. Construction of capital equipment, maintenance of operation and support equipment, and human labor and employee commute are all excluded from this life cycle assessment. This assessment is cradle-to-gate and excludes any processes downstream of the manufacturer.\r\nNo other known processes within the system boundary were excluded. All data was provided by the manufacturers and reviewed by the manufacturers again after the results had been calculated to ensure completeness. The mass balance for this process was calculated.","dataSelectionDescription":"Data was collected from four manufacturers which represent 100% of the S-PVC resin produced in the US in 2022.
