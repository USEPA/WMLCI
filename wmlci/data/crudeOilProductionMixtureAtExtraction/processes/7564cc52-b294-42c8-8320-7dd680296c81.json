The CAPDET Works software package (maintained by Hydromantis) is the source of inventory data for sludge transport and basic infrastructure. Landfill methane production was calculated using methods described in Appendix F of the study report. Fugitive methane emissions were estimated using methods from the IPCC greenhouse gas inventory guidelines. Emissions of disinfecton by-products, heavy metals and toxic organics were estimated based on typical influent concentrations, estimated removal within wastewater treatment processes and partitioning to sludge as identified in the literature. A 5% leakage rate was assumed for landfill leachate.\r\n\r\n","completenessDescription":"A mass balance was used to partition DBPs, toxic organics and heavy metals between biosolids, wastewater effluent and the share of each compound that biodegrades. Degradation by-products are not tracked within the inventory. \r\n\r\n","dataSelectionDescription":"All outputs of the CAPDET model that could be used to develop LCI data were included in the model. Additional data on fugitive methane emissions to air and the partitioning of disinfection by-products, toxic organics and heavy metals to sludge and subsequent release in landfill leachate were developed from literature sources to supplement gaps in the inventory.\r\n\r\n","dataTreatmentDescription":"Outputs of the CAPDET model are reported on an annual (energy, chemicals) or lifetime (infrastructure) basis. Annual quantities are standardized to the functional unit by dividing by the average quantity of wastewater treated per year. For inventory data reported on a lifetime basis, quantities are standardized to the functional unit by amortizing the inventory item over the expected lifespan of the infrastructure component. See Appendices B, C and D of the study report for a detailed explanation of the methods and data used to model the fate of disinfection by-products, heavy metals and toxic organics. \r\n","samplingDescription":"\"System boundaries of the treatment process include sludge transport, basic sludge storage infrastructure (excavation, concrete, steel), and toxic organic, metal and fugitive methane emissions from a landfill. Avoided energy benefits can be included by setting the value of the included process parameter to 1. To reflect the full scope of wastewater treatment impacts this process must be used with the associated wastwater treatment and effluent release processes.
