{"@type":"Process","@id":"53bb995e-2b64-4464-87f4-a3b79dcd1c32","name":"Ethylene dichloride-vinyl chloride monomer, EDC-VCM; at plant","description":"This unit process represents the production of 1 kg of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) for use in PVC manufacturing. This process represents all VCM produced by the suspension grade PVC resin manufacturers in the United States. The creation of ethylene dichloride (EDC) for use in VCM production is included within this model. As EDC and VCM production are often conducted simultaneously, the facilities were not all able to provide data specific to EDC or VCM production but were able to provide data for the overall VCM production. The process LCI data were thus aggregated to create a weighted average for the overall EDC/VCM process. The studied system includes all processes involved in the VCM production process, including incoming transport.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"00.01.005","lastChange":"2025-03-31T02:04:20.130Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2022-01-01","validUntil":"2022-12-31","timeDescription":"This data represents operations for the 2022 calendar year.","geographyDescription":"This data represents eight manufacturing sites located in Texas and Louisiana.","technologyDescription":"This process represents the VCM production process used to produce suspension grade PVC resin. Commercially, two main processes are used to produce EDC: direct chlorination and oxychlorination. The plants within this study use a combination of these processes. In direct chlorination, a reaction occurs between ethylene and chlorine using a catalyst. Oxychlorination occurs when hydrogen chloride is catalyzed to react in the presence of excess oxygen and ethylene. Direct chlorination, oxychlorination, and the creation of VCM from EDC are often conducted simultaneously. VCM is produced through the thermal cracking of EDC. In this process, the EDC is fed into a furnace where hydrogen chloride is separated from the VCM under high temperatures. The hydrogen chloride produced is then fed back into and consumed by the oxychlorination reaction.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional","modelingConstantsDescription":"Data was collected from four manufacturers which represent 100% of the S-PVC resin produced in 2022. A total of eight facilities provided their data for 2022 and the LCI was developed using mass allocation. Data was reviewed and verified by each of the four companies. EDC and VCM production typically occur concurrently and so the stages have been combined. Where EDC and VCM production are reported separately, the LCI for EDC is combined with a weighted average for the company. Then VCM production is calculated using the specified weight of EDC within the product recipe as an input. The final VCM product is included with the rest of the facilities for the industry average. The cogeneration process of electricity and steam is similar across the EDC/VCM plants to produce S-PVC resin. The cogeneration process produces 54% electricity and 46% steam. Emissions to water and air were considered within the scope of this study and were accounted for based off of quantities in annual emissions reporting from each company. Data validation was performed through mass balances.\r\n","completenessDescription":"The following cut-off criteria was used throughout the study. Processes whose total contribution to the final result, with respect to their mass and in relation to all considered impact categories, is less than 1% can be neglected. The sum of the neglected processes may not exceed 5% by mass and by 5% of the considered impact categories. Construction of capital equipment, maintenance of operation and support equipment, and human labor and employee commute are all excluded from this life cycle assessment. This assessment is cradle-to-gate and excludes any processes downstream of the manufacturer. No other known processes within the system boundary were excluded. All data was provided by the manufacturers and reviewed by the manufacturers again after the results had been calculated to ensure completeness. The mass balance for this process was calculated.","dataSelectionDescription":"Data was collected from four manufacturers (eight facilities) which represent 100% of the S-PVC resin produced in the US in 2022.
