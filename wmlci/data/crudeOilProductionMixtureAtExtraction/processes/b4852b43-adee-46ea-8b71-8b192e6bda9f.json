The CAPDET Works software package (maintained by Hydromantis) is the source of inventory data for biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, solids, and nutrients. Process greenhouse gas emissions were estimated using calculations from the IPCC greenhouse gas inventory guidelines. Emissions of disinfecton by-products, heavy metals and toxic organics were estimated based on typical influent concentrations and estimated removal within wastewater treatment processes identified in the literature. \r\n\r\n","completenessDescription":"A subset of common, well-studied toxic organics is included in the inventory. The sum of all pollutants contained in the effluent is less than 0.01% of the mass of treated effluent. CAPDET works balances mass to model effluent quality and sludge quantity. A mass balance was used to partition DBPs, toxic organics and heavy metals between biosolids, wastewater effluent and the share of each compound that biodegrades. Degradation by-products are not tracked within the inventory. \r\n\r\n","dataSelectionDescription":"All outputs of the CAPDET model that could be used to develop LCI data were included in the model.
